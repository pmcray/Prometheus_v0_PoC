## Abstract

This document outlines the detailed work plan for the next major phase of the Project Prometheus demonstrator, v0.15. This phase, titled "The Toolmaker," is designed to demonstrate one of the most profound and practical aspects of ultraintelligence: the ability of a machine to improve not just its own internal software, but the very tools it uses to interact with the world. The system will learn to identify when its existing tools are inadequate for a given task, design a new, more powerful tool to overcome this limitation, synthesize the code for that tool, and then integrate and use its new creation to solve the original problem more effectively. This is a direct and powerful demonstration of a machine building its own instruments to extend its own capabilities, a cornerstone of rapid intelligence growth.

## Task 1: Implement Tool Benchmarking and Performance Introspection

### Rationale

Before an agent can decide to build a better tool, it must first be able to recognize that its current tools are a bottleneck. This requires the ability to benchmark tool performance and perform "introspection" on the results.

### Methodology

1.  **Create a Tool Benchmark:** A new, challenging benchmark will be created for the `ToyChemistrySim`. This benchmark will be designed to be solvable, but highly inefficient with the current tool (e.g., requiring hundreds of individual `mix` and `heat` calls).
2.  **Upgrade `PerformanceLogger` for Tool Metrics:** The `PerformanceLogger` will be upgraded to log performance metrics for tool usage, such as execution time, number of calls, and the success rate of tasks that rely on that tool.
3.  **Upgrade `PlannerAgent` - Tool Introspection:** The `PlannerAgent` will be given a new capability: **tool introspection**. After a failed or inefficient task, it will analyze the `performance_log.json` to determine if the root cause of the failure was a limitation of an external tool.
4.  **New `PlannerAgent` Method - `generate_tool_critique`:** The `PlannerAgent` will be given a new method that takes the performance log as input and generates a natural-language "tool critique."

### Deliverables

-   A new, challenging benchmark designed to highlight the inefficiency of the `ToyChemistrySim`.
-   An upgraded `PerformanceLogger` that captures tool-specific performance data.
-   A `PlannerAgent` with a new `generate_tool_critique` method that can analyze tool performance and identify bottlenecks.

### Verification

When run on the new benchmark, the `PlannerAgent` must successfully generate a critique that correctly identifies the `ToyChemistrySim` as the performance bottleneck, citing specific metrics from the performance log.

## Task 2: Implement Tool Synthesis and Dynamic Registration

### Rationale

This is the core of the "Toolmaker" concept. The system will take its critique of an existing tool and use it to design and synthesize a new, superior version.

### Methodology

1.  **Upgrade `PlannerAgent` - Tool Specification:** The `PlannerAgent` will be upgraded to take a tool critique and generate a high-level, natural-language *specification* for a new, improved tool.
2.  **Upgrade `CoderAgent` - `synthesize_tool`:** The `CoderAgent` will be given a new method, `synthesize_tool`. It will take the natural-language specification from the `PlannerAgent` and generate the complete, syntactically correct Python code for the new tool, saving it as a new file (e.g., `prometheus/tools/optimized_chemistry_sim.py`).
3.  **Upgrade `MCSSupervisor` - Dynamic Tool Registration:** The `MCSSupervisor` will be upgraded with a `tool_registry`. It will be able to dynamically import the newly created tool file and add the new tool to its registry, making it available for all agents to use.

### Deliverables

-   An upgraded `PlannerAgent` that can generate a detailed, natural-language specification for a new tool.
-   An upgraded `CoderAgent` with a `synthesize_tool` method that can translate this specification into a new, functional Python file.
-   An `MCSSupervisor` with a dynamic `tool_registry` that can load and integrate new tools at runtime.

### Verification

The `PlannerAgent` must generate a clear specification for an `OptimizedChemistrySim`. The `CoderAgent` must then successfully create a new `prometheus/tools/optimized_chemistry_sim.py` file containing a valid Python class. The `MCSSupervisor` must then successfully load and register this new tool.

## Task 3: Demonstration - The Self-Equipped Scientist

### Rationale

This task closes the loop and provides a powerful demonstration of the system's new capabilities. The system will encounter a problem, realize its tools are inadequate, build itself a better tool, and then use that new tool to solve the problem efficiently.

### Methodology

1.  **New `MCSSupervisor` Method - `run_tool_rsi_cycle`:** A new, high-level orchestration method will be created in the `MCSSupervisor`. This method will execute the full tool-making RSI loop.
2.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The `MCSSupervisor` dynamically loads and registers the new `OptimizedChemistrySim`. The `BrainMap` is updated to show the new tool as a permanent part of the system's capabilities.
3.  **Verification Run:** The supervisor gives the system the *same* benchmark again. This time, the `PlannerAgent` must be smart enough to recognize that the new `OptimizedChemistrySim` is a better choice for this task. It uses the new tool and successfully completes the benchmark in a fraction of the time/steps.

### Deliverables

-   A new `run_tool_rsi_cycle` method in the `MCSSupervisor`.
-   A final, polished demonstration cell in the notebook.

### Verification

The final output of the notebook must clearly show the system failing to solve a problem due to an inefficient tool, designing and synthesizing a new, superior tool, choosing to use its new tool on the second attempt, and a dramatic, measurable improvement in performance.
