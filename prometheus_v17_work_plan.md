## Abstract

This document outlines the detailed work plan for the next major phase of the Project Prometheus demonstrator, v0.17. This phase, titled "The Economist," is designed to implement and demonstrate a crucial and often overlooked aspect of advanced AI: **Internal Governance and Resource Management**. The system will move from a state of unlimited computational resources to one where it must operate within a finite "budget." Agents will have to compete for these resources, and the system will learn to allocate its budget intelligently, rewarding efficient agents and penalizing wasteful ones. This is a direct demonstration of an internal governance mechanism designed to improve efficiency and ensure that the system's actions are aligned with its high-level goalsâ€”a critical step towards building a safe and practical ultraintelligent machine.

## Task 1: Implement a Resource Management and Cost-Tracking Framework

### Rationale

To manage resources, the system must first be able to quantify them. This task establishes a formal "economy" within the agent mesh, where computational effort has a quantifiable cost.

### Methodology

1.  **New `ResourceManager` Agent:** A new, high-level agent will be synthesized. Its sole purpose is to manage a global "computational budget" (e.g., a pool of "compute units"). It will be responsible for dispensing the budget and tracking its usage.
2.  **Upgrade `PerformanceLogger` for Cost Tracking:** The `PerformanceLogger` will be upgraded to log not just the performance of an agent, but also the *cost* of its actions. Every significant action will have an associated compute unit cost.
3.  **Upgrade Agents for Cost Estimation:** The core agents (`PlannerAgent`, `CoderAgent`, etc.) will be upgraded with a new method: `estimate_cost()`. This method will provide a rough estimate of how many compute units an agent needs to perform a given task.

### Deliverables

-   A new `ResourceManager` agent that can track a global budget.
-   An upgraded `PerformanceLogger` that logs the computational cost of all major agent actions.
-   Upgraded core agents that can provide cost estimates for their actions.

### Verification

A test will be created where a simple task is executed. The `ResourceManager` must correctly deduct the cost of the task from the global budget, and the `PerformanceLogger` must accurately record the transaction.

## Task 2: Implement a Bidding System and Performance-Based Rewards

### Rationale

This task introduces the core economic incentive structure. Agents will no longer be simply activated; they will have to "bid" for the resources they need. The system will learn to favor agents that have a track record of success, creating a competitive internal market that drives efficiency.

### Methodology

1.  **Upgrade `PlannerAgent` - Bid Generation:** The `PlannerAgent` will be upgraded to generate a "bid" for its plans, including the sequence of agents to be activated and the total estimated cost.
2.  **Upgrade `MCSSupervisor` - The Auctioneer:** The `MCSSupervisor` will be upgraded to act as an "auctioneer," evaluating bids based on cost-effectiveness and the past success rate of the agents involved.
3.  **Implement a Reward Mechanism:** The `ResourceManager` will be upgraded with a reward mechanism. When a plan succeeds, the agents involved will have their internal "reputation" score increased, giving them a bidding advantage in future auctions.

### Deliverables

-   An upgraded `PlannerAgent` that can generate costed bids for its plans.
-   An upgraded `MCSSupervisor` that can run an "auction" to select the most promising plan.
-   A `ResourceManager` that can reward successful agents with an improved reputation.

### Verification

A test will be created with two competing plans: a low-cost, low-reputation plan and a high-cost, high-reputation plan. The `MCSSupervisor` must correctly select the high-reputation plan, demonstrating a strategic, performance-based decision.

## Task 3: Demonstration - The Efficient Allocator

### Rationale

This task provides a clear and compelling demonstration of the system's new economic intelligence. The system will learn from failure and make the strategic decision to invest more resources for a guaranteed success.

### Methodology

1.  **Create a "Flaky" vs. "Reliable" Tool Scenario:** A new `FlakyCompilerTool` will be created (cheap, 50% failure rate) and the existing `CompilerTool` will be made more expensive but 100% reliable.
2.  **New `MCSSupervisor` Method - `run_budgeted_cycle`:** A new, high-level orchestration method will be created in the `MCSSupervisor`.
3.  **The Scenario:** The system is given a complex coding task and a limited budget. It will first choose the cheap, flaky tool to conserve its budget. After this tool fails, the system will reflect on the failure, lower the tool's reputation, and re-allocate a larger portion of its budget to the reliable tool to guarantee success.
4.  **Final Demonstration Cell:** A final, polished demonstration cell will be created in the notebook that clearly visualizes the budget, the failed first attempt, the re-allocation decision, and the successful second attempt.

### Deliverables

-   A new `FlakyCompilerTool` for the demonstration scenario.
-   A new `run_budgeted_cycle` method in the `MCSSupervisor`.
-   A final, polished demonstration cell in the notebook.

### Verification

The final output of the notebook must clearly show the system initially choosing a cheap, risky path, learning from that failure, and then making a deliberate, strategic decision to spend more of its budget for a higher probability of success.
