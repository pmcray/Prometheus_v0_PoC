    "This notebook contains the full implementation and demonstration of the Project Prometheus v0 Proof of Concept. It is designed to be a self-contained, executable narrative that demonstrates the four core principles of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** A decentralized mesh of specialized agents (Planner, Coder, Evaluator) work together to solve a complex coding task.\n",
    "2.  **Causal Reasoning for AI Alignment:** A simulated Causal Attention Head guides the Coder Agent to focus on causally relevant aspects of the code, preventing it from being distracted by superficial correlations.\n",
    "3.  **Recursive Self-Improvement:** The Causal Reinforcement Learning from Self-Correction (CRLS) loop allows the system to evaluate its own work based on causal principles and attempt to correct its mistakes.\n",
    "4.  **Internal Governance for Safety:** The Modern Centrencephalic System (MCS) acts as an internal alignment governor, providing meta-level oversight to ensure the system's actions remain aligned with safety principles."
