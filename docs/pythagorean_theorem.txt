# The Pythagorean Theorem

In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

This can be expressed with the formula: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where 'c' is the hypotenuse.

For the purposes of a formal proof, we can state this as:
`theorem pythagorean_theorem (a b c : Real) (h : a^2 + b^2 = c^2) : a^2 + b^2 = c^2`
